# gas-station-attendant-part-2
1 - add a gas station model, 2 - add trigger colliders to detect reaching locations, 3 - add attendant animations  Now is this second video, lets actually have the gas station attendent come from a garage to put gas in the car and then go back to the garage.  The animations we will play will be just like if a car pulled into a gas station and an attendent came up to put gas in a car.  Then the car can pull off and continue racing with a full tank of gas.
